# 01-HTML-Git-CSS
Week one challenge

Cleaned up the HTML and CSS for a marketing company's website to meet accessability standards.

Got too eager and did a lot of work before noticing the Git commit requirements of the project. 

Felt a bit silly about about that, but it gave me a chance to optimize the ridiculously large images (lowering their size from nearly 50 mb to under 2 mb.)

Added some SEO optimazations as well.
